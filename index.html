    <h2>Education Background</h2>
    <h4><p>I went to Montecito preschool for a while when I was a small bean. Then I went to Oak Elementary School,
        and my dad would carry my on his shoulders every day to school. He stopped doing that when I got too heavy :( I then
    attended Blach Middle School for two years, then went to high school at Mountain View High School, and I was
    lucky enough to be able to walk every day because I only live a block away. Now I go to Occidental College in Los Angeles which
        is a gr9 school.</p></h4>
    <h4><p>In Middle school I was in the orchestra and took Spanish both years as my electives, however in high school I branched out and
        was able to take classes such as more Spanish, photography, engineering, dance, and comp sci and electives. </p></h4>
